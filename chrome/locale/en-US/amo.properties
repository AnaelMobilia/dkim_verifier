amo.summary = Verifies the DKIM-Signatures of e-mails.

amo.description = Verifies the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM Signatures</a> of e-mails.\nThe result of the verification is shown in the e-mail header, and optionally by a status bar, highlighting the sender's address or a tooltip for the From header.\n\nAdditionally, some actions, like the re-verification of the DKIM signature, are available through the "Other Actions" drop-down menu in the e-mail header. Also, sign rules can be used to specify that certain e-mails should always be signed. More about sign rules at <a href="https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/wiki/Sign-rules">https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/wiki/Sign-rules</a>.\n\nA description of the available add-on options can be found at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/wiki/Options.

amo.developerComments = Support is given at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/issues, http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2704121 or by e-mail to dkim.verifier.addon@gmail.com (in English or German).\n\nThe preferred way to report bugs is by creating an issue at https://github.com/lieser/dkim_verifier/issues.

amo.privacyPolicy = The Add-on queries a DNS Server (default Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8) or the one configured in the OS) for a TXT record specified in the signature, which contains the public key of the signature.\nThis will happen every time an e-mail with a DKIM Signature is viewed.\n\nIf the use of DMARC is enabled additional DNS lookups may be done, even if not DKIM signed e-mail are viewed.
